                <p>Care and Actions for Strays (CAS) was founded in 2005 to rescue, rehabilitate and care for animals neglected, abused and in need of medical attention or care. The founding members have each had extensive experience in assisting and caring for animals in distress. They recognized the need for improvement in many areas of animal welfare in Brunei as  well as a need for an effective and humane urban stray management program to create a better environment for the whole society.</p>
                <p>At the core of the CAS vision is to seek and implement no-kill solutions (unless for critically ill / injured animals with no chance of a full recovery) to the urban stray problem and animals in need. Through a series of identified projects, CAS aims to take action in the Brunei community to bring out the best in Bruneians and to bring about a place where people and animals co-exist harmoniously medical attention or care.</p>
